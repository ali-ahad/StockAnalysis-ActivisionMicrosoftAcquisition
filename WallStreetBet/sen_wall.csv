The reason being that if the FTC does sue to block Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard, it's likely because they believe that the deal would be anticompetitive and hurt consumers. However, I believe that Microsoft would ultimately prevail in court and be allowed to go through with the acquisition. Therefore, I think there's more upside potential for ATVI than downside risk at this point.",[0.23283057 0.5482776  0.21889183],neutral
