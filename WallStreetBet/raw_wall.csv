2,2023-04-26 12:28:30,"In a few weeks someone will report on how Warren Buffet fortuitously managed to get out of his position in the 2 days prior to the block announcement because ""Close enough was near enough for him.""  

Just like he somehow got the idea in his head to invest in a videogame company a couple months before the acquisition announcement.

What they won't report on is how Warren Buffet already knew about the CMA blocking and it was his people that leaked that it was going to get approved."

35,2023-04-27 03:51:41,Britain is falling apart internally... But they need to weigh in about two American companies.

47,2023-04-26 14:54:17,"They are both headquartered in the US,how can britain block it? Couldnt they just merge and force britain to bar them from that country if they dont like it? I mean not being in the Uk isnt like the states or india in terms of people."

50,2023-04-26 15:32:25,"Worst case scenario I'd imagine is Microsoft tells British regulator to go pound sand and after buying Activation just not release any activision games to Britian.

90,2023-04-26 13:48:47,Sounds about right
91,2023-04-26 14:08:59,How dare you. He is the oracle of Omaha. Warren Buffet is a time traveler who knows exactly when to buy and sell stocks. His trades have nothing to do with his connections to the government and business elites.
92,2023-04-26 15:50:27,Buffet is know for his long term dividend based investments in America staple products. Of all the traders out there his strategy is one of the least likely to be used with insider trading. Not to say he didn‚Äôt make an exception to his rules here. There is no way to know. But there are much worse players in the market that is for sure.
93,2023-04-26 15:31:35,Do you have any info on Buffett getting out or just pulling it out of your ass?
95,2023-04-26 18:33:23,It wasn‚Äôt Warren Buffett‚Äôs idea - likely Tedd Combs or Ted Weschler. Still BRK but not Buffett. [Source](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-combs-weschler-activision-blizzard-annual-meeting-2022-4?amp)

104,2023-04-27 05:37:55,the funny thing is I was looking at the options yesterday and they OI on puts was wayy higher than calls. I was like 'This feels weird' but I didn't do shit because I'm a greedy boy and sold $95 calls
105,2023-04-27 09:42:08,He doesn‚Äôt run the firm anymore
106,2023-04-26 15:52:29,Realistically they can't. Microsoft could do it and the UK would then say they can no longer sell games in the UK and the Microsoft can have a pair of balls and tell them they will allow it or they will shut down windows in the UK.
108,2023-04-26 20:49:20,Because they know both imperial and metric systems

134,2023-04-26 18:45:14,Either way shareholders win. Activision will do a ton of buybacks if the deal fails.

I mean tech is currently super bottlenecked, but I'd be shocked if Cloud gaming doesn't eventually become a large part of gaming in general.


Probably not in it's current blegh iteration. But for things like not requiring a 1tb download and instead just having it on the cloud and streaming in the files needed for that part of the game."

142,2023-04-26 17:41:33,"Cloud gaming on the new Xbox is honestly underrated. The fact that I can hop on and play almost any game pass game, without installing it, with no noticeable delay or loss of quality is crazy to me.

I generally use it to try a game out for an hour before committing to the install. 

I‚Äôve even 100%ed entire games without installing them."

749,2023-06-13 12:19:46,Honestly this is just a bad decision. Cloud gaming makes up less than 1% of total gaming revenue and its future is uncertain. Both Sony and Nintendo are much larger players in gaming and the argument over Microsoft keeping games like COD off of PlayStation is stupid since they have so many exclusives of their own. Blocking this move benefits the market leaders and does note promote competition

768,2023-06-13 14:14:30,"Neither Nintendo nor Sony have a bigger footprint in the gaming world than Microsoft.  Microsoft has almost all pc gaming as well as the Xbox.  

You are correct in saying ps has its own exclusives but none of them are on the same popularity scale as COD, or Elder scrolls.

As a PlayStation player, having all my favourite games becoming Xbox exclusives is getting pretty tiring and it‚Äôs eventually gonna make me buy an Xbox

I‚Äôm glad they are trying to block the sale personally."

770,2023-06-13 12:28:52,"Not good. Sony is the dominant force in console gaming. The number of exclusives they have is ridiculous. This move will make gaming more competitive, and force companies to more compete for our money.

Sony's complaint is a load of frog wash. COD is to valuable to make an exclusive. Microsoft would make more money making it multi-console than an exclusive."

994,2022-10-16 20:50:10,Regulators will certainly have an impact however Microsoft wants Activision bad enough that yes I suspect they will come to various agreements and potentially spin off or sell specific components of the company to finalize the acquisition.

Microsoft could spin off COD to be a standalone studio to help get the deal done as far as Sony is concerned, but a deal this big isn't just about Sony crying over COD."
1000,2022-10-17 09:33:53,"Microsoft has a history in gaming. A history of investing in good game ideas, but not providing enough budget for development time. They do have a better track record than blizzard, but the real cash cow is King. All those mobile games are lucrative.

1007,2022-10-16 21:16:28,It literally is. I think UK had like 5 points how COD can destroy Sony and create an everlasting monopoly. That's the only point regulators are focusing on besides cloud gaming which has no legs as all the people they asked say it isn't a big deal and non of the games are currently in any cloud gaming service.

I am however keeping an eye on it. If the EU also block the deal you may see an overreaction and capitulation.

1112,2023-06-29 15:31:54,"Bot is wrong. If you feel like the deal will be blocked the move is to short Activision. When buyouts are pending the stock prices of the buyout target are propped up artificially and that prop collapses when the deal dies.

If anything Microsoft would pop on the news of the deal being blocked."
1113,2023-06-29 16:08:53,Why does the rule only apply to Microsoft? Sony has been buying studios for years and making games exclusive. Sony now owns Bungie who created Halo.
1114,2023-06-30 00:11:13,are you currently reading comments from the testimony ? It seems more favorable towards Microsoft.
1115,2023-06-29 20:04:21,"Man something happened near close, my puts just 300% without the price changing lol. Big volume on those 6/30 82s"
1116,2023-06-29 20:10:25,"I suppose a temporary ""freak out"" drop that is quickly recovered could happen."
1117,2023-06-29 18:20:31,Bro this was perfect thank you alot
1118,2023-06-29 15:24:42,"Oh yes, they have each other's backs :)"
1119,2023-06-29 16:51:48,scope.  sony's nowhere near as big as msft and none of their pickups are anywhere near as big as $70B
1120,2023-06-30 02:06:28,"oh yes, Microsoft does seem to have an upper hand right now :)"
1121,2023-06-29 20:09:16,"yoo I saw that too. I had one 82 dollar put option expiring 6/30 so I sold it for 20 dollars per contract a minute before market close. 

The rest of my contracts are 78 dollar strike, 80 dollar strike and 81 dollar strike expiring 6/30. 

This trade really makes me scared :("
1122,2023-06-29 20:13:46,"What do you think will happen tomorrow?

This is like one of those all or nothing binary play I did last time. When I correctly predicted that Cytokinetic's heart failure drug would not get FDA approval, I still lost a lot of money buying Cytokinetic put options. :(

I hope I don't mess up this time again."

1125,2023-06-29 20:45:34,"There's quite a few possibilities. I don't necessarily agree that the deal falling through will crater ATVI (def not long term) and this judge could just give the middle finger to Europoors (United Kingdom, who gives a shit about thier opinion?) AND the FTC. Judges' son works for MSFT üòÜ."
1126,2023-06-29 20:48:48,What's gonna happen today bebi?
1127,2023-06-30 03:42:26,They definitely still have a chance. It could be just like the Epic Games vs. Apple case where the judge still rules in favor of the underdog.
1129,2023-05-15 19:47:01,Activision has the letters A.I. so it's a buy
1130,2023-05-16 03:40:06,"FTC is going to be the wait and see,but legally they don't really have a leg to stand on blocking in the USA IMO.   Stock is in a solid position right now, with Diablo 4 release around the corner it should stay fairly stable I would imagine, maybe get back to the 80-83 range, but if FTC does not approve it will probably drop more. If FTC approves then everybody else will fall into line, and it's just the UK standing in the way.. waiting patiently on their ""donations"""
1131,2023-05-15 19:01:11,Doesn‚Äôt matter. UK rejected.
1132,2023-05-15 22:06:30,EU approval and then MSFT will get approval in appeals court in the US once the FTC loses its lawsuit. Thank you  courts for making my calls print the deal is gei done.
1133,2023-05-15 23:29:55,"5yr from now, this will be a costly buy for msft."
1134,2023-05-16 04:17:21,The short on MSFT says it goes red for a little after div payout tho

1137,2023-05-15 19:15:46,The UK rejection happened before the EU. The EU is the higher authority.
1138,2023-05-17 02:57:22,Doesnt matter. The said there is a pathway without CMA and them not approving it will alienate them baddly in the future. It looks like the deal will go through
1139,2023-05-15 22:14:54,I agree this will get done now that EU approved. Grats on getting in on the Activision stock... would've done so myself but don't have the financial resources to do so.
1140,2023-05-16 01:44:36,It's going through.  Money talks and this is America baby! The rest will fall in line . Long ATVI!
1141,2023-05-16 03:44:12,"Will it though?  
 
The buy is for the expertise to get into mobile gaming which is wildly lucrative, while also taking a solid dump all over PlayStations exclusive deals with COD, where they will make COD a first party titles and thus free day one for game pass owners.  
  
None of that is going to be affected negatively much in 5 years, even if there's a recession and purchases go down briefly."

1149,2023-05-15 19:31:06,"Lol. It does. The deal will be cancelled.

1150,2023-05-17 03:01:35,Blows my mind too. There are already other sources stating that the UK blocking doesn‚Äôt make a difference.
1151,2023-05-15 19:35:04,The article OP posts even talks about how the EU approval is a win after the UK blocked it.
1152,2023-05-15 19:41:31,It isnt
1153,2023-05-15 21:12:49,The FTC is likely to block it too.

If they go past the deal date and need another shareholder vote MSFT would probably sweeten the price to get it done. But I can‚Äôt imagine that‚Äôs what the bankers or management teams involved want as a Plan A, and this ruling should keep them on track. 

But they do still have to do something around UK."

1358,2023-07-11 19:38:27,"Well there‚Äôs also a lot of housekeeping that needs to happen.  Activision has sexual abuse issues, issues with game developers and compensation, and generally becoming the place no one in the industry wants to work.

1368,2023-07-12 13:04:57,He trimmed the position after he already made money.  He still kept like 88% of his position which is almost 8.5% of the entire company...

1428,2022-02-22 16:56:07,Insider trading in our faces. But it doesn't count becuase the rich can't insider trade it just the poor and want to rich ppl lol what a  fucking joke.
1429,2022-02-22 17:07:39,When did he buy it? What day and month?
1430,2022-02-22 17:28:09,"Please dont say this guy is genius,it is obvious he takes hints from somewhere"
1431,2022-02-21 20:52:15,"Warren: pwned you so hard that round.

Bill: easy there old man don't have a heart attack.

Warren: This games so fun I'm going to buy some of the company

Bill: not if I don't convince my board to buy all of it first."
1432,2022-02-21 23:37:42,idk his bff Bill?
1433,2022-02-22 03:37:27,I saw the stock price and bought as much as I could. I don‚Äôt see why buffet wouldn‚Äôt do that. This company was trading for $95 a year ago and nothing about their business model or IP changed.
1434,2022-02-22 03:37:28,"You think it's worth it to do insider trading with 0.2% of a 500B portfolio? Risking legal trouble for a small ass gain when you are already insanely wealthy....

No, it's probably just them taking advantage of the dip in price."
1435,2022-02-22 03:46:56,Are you dumb? I  moved a good chunk of my portfolio into it when the sex stuff cooled down. Was I insider trading or buying a dip not related to the financials of the company?
1436,2022-02-22 16:30:28,It was an obvious play. Even I saw it. The company was undervalued from the scandal. Who's to say MSFT didn't chase Warren.
1437,2022-02-22 16:57:11,"Totally. He definitely had zero knowledge about Microsoft buying the company. His mega billionaire friend Bill surely knew nothing of this deal. All is fair and legit, move along."
1438,2022-02-22 06:08:32,Best thing about this is the huuuuge media attention and the SEC giving this all they got.
1439,2022-02-22 07:13:23,"Most trades Warren does is what the common person would call insider trading, but not legally insider trading.

Before buying shares of a company Buffett flies out to the company and has a meeting with management before making a decision.  That's about as close as you can get to the legal definition of insider trading without it being insider trading.  He does this for I believe all of the companies he buys."
1440,2022-02-22 07:32:36,"Bullshit, tons of people were super bullish on ATVI in the months leading up to the acquisition."
1441,2022-03-04 03:30:22,The guy dropped a billion dollars into a company at the peak of sexual harassment allegations. It's called value investing and what Buffet is known for.
1442,2022-02-22 16:40:34,The price had dipped big time due to sexual allegations against several employees (including the ceo who was rumored to be stepping down because of it). It was a HUGE value play on his part whether microsoft was going to buy them or not. Any gamer knows rhat blizz has been one of  the biggest names in gaming for a loooong time.

1486,2022-02-21 21:15:52,Oh so he bought all those shares to run Activision? I missed that in the announcement. Kind of a big legal step to skip if he's investing all that money and not disclosing it is with the intent of shaking up management. That's a bit of information other investors would be entitled to.
1487,2022-02-21 21:13:07,Mhm

1569,2023-10-15 00:02:47,Yes the subscription thing is very real. I think when GTA 6 comes out it will require a GTA+ subscription to play. Right now it's only to give Xtra money and cars. PlayStation makes you pay to play online and they are raising cost in a month. It's going to be 150 bucks a year for highest tier they do plan on offering better games you get to play for free also limited access to new Sony core platform which is the catalog of movies they own.

I saw stock going from $65 to 100 in a couple years. Wasn't expecting Microsoft to buy it out for $95 per share. 

Anyway I got a couple more shares today. At $81 now and being bought for $95. It's also worth that anyway if the sale doesn't go through."

They're straight garbage and news media don't talk about that decline in sales. Also I think they will finally stop pushing a game every year for cod I was reading so less sales for them lots to think about crypto and stock market are bleeding I would take those gains and buy something else if I was holding the stock if you got in low last month

What I want to know is what part of ATVI does MSFT really want? Its devs? Its subscribers that aren't already on Xbox? It's authenticator (jk)?  One or two titles?

MSFT has a habit of buying a whole company just to get one core nugget they lack, and discarding the rest of the company through sale or repurposing. What is that nugget?"

2077,2022-01-19 07:01:56,"They‚Äôre really gathering heavyweights. Obviously they‚Äôve had some big names (Halo, etc) already, but with Bethesda (Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Diablo) and now AB (CoD, WoW, Overwatch) they‚Äôre gonna be incredibly substantial in the video game world from here out"
2078,2022-01-19 09:31:32,is it really a discount tho? ATVI ATH is 101. they're buying at 95. if they negotiated a deal at around 50-70 then it'd be a fantastic deal

2090,2022-01-19 05:55:14,Makes me think they are gearing up for licensing games for film. Idk why I thought of this
2091,2022-01-19 13:54:19,All the glory years of Blizzard and Activision are behind us. Gaming + woke is a good reason to turn off the consoles and go spend more time in nature. I have lost all interest for gaming.

2113,2022-01-19 08:07:57,Playstation/Sony has had way better exclusives than msft/Xbox for years. The only reason why I (and probably many others) buy a PS over XBOX every time. Sony will be fine
2114,2022-01-19 11:26:46,Bungie is an independent studio yo
2115,2022-01-19 11:40:42,Bill Gates retired from microsoft like 20 years ago. He's so damn old he probably doesn't know what a microsoft is anymore.

2131,2022-01-19 02:02:25,Lmfao‚Ä¶ antitrust in video game land? Get fuckin real. Gaming is probably 15% of their business portfolio and this doesn‚Äôt corner the game content market by any stretch. Does make them the 800lb ape in a room full of chimps though
2132,2022-01-19 03:08:23,Msft would maybe consider buying gme at .69B and they still wouldn't buy it

2135,2022-01-19 07:41:49,"King is probably the bigger win financially. Their financial report had WoW as about 4% of their earnings, CoD massively eclipses it and Candy Crush makes them both look tiny.
Mobile casual games may be awful, but the market is massive."

2137,2022-01-19 08:27:47,"Yeah overall this isn't actually a bad buy for them, but technically a lot of people seem to think they over paid for them. I guess that depends what their plan is for their games and brand during the next 10 years."
2138,2022-01-19 11:19:14,"> from 04-10 it made 10 billion alone. 

What a timely financial figure!"
2139,2022-01-19 13:15:51,Disney buying Marvel for $4 billion was a steal. This seems reasonable.
2140,2022-01-19 12:23:02,At 68 billion it would take like 34 years to recoup the investment. FY20 net income was like 2bill for ATVI
2141,2022-01-19 07:14:43,Dont forget the most profitable game of all time. Candy crush. Blizzard owns king.
2142,2022-01-19 07:34:50,"Diablo is Blizzard game, not Bethesda game. MS also has Doom"
2143,2022-01-19 10:29:14,I'm thinking Microsoft is gearing up to make Game Pass into the Netflix of video games. Just recently got it and am already impressed with number of quality game options.

2144,2022-01-19 10:34:58,"And Gamepass is basically most people's favourite avenue to new games, add in the fact that MS have the best game stream service Xcloud as well and you have a VERY strong future."

Sounds about like Microsoft."
2146,2022-01-19 12:39:54,"definitely not a big discount

no argument there

still cheaper than if they werent putting coworkers breast milk in their cereal though"
2147,2022-01-19 10:39:17,"They're buying at 68

Edit: nvm I assume you meant stock price?"
2148,2022-01-19 15:38:18,Imagine how much it would have cost if the stock was at 95 or 101. This is a steal. You buy at the price you think the product will be worth after you own it and implement your changes.
2149,2022-01-19 10:23:37,MS is a big enough hodl'r to never worry about things as stupid as the market. Their OS dominance would allow some of the most blatant market manipulation through their news app alone.
2150,2022-01-19 12:18:49,Stocks only go up.
2151,2022-01-19 08:18:16,How is buying a 100 billion dollar company for 68 cents on the dollar overpaying? There is no indication that the stock market is going to drop anywhere near that much.
2152,2022-01-19 07:41:05,Can you please explain further / more detailed what you mean please?
2153,2022-01-19 08:43:06,"Because you're on reddit. Reddit has a lot of gamers. Activision blizzard used to make good games, now make poo poo games. Gamers think new owner means better games."

It was there, it got sold the first two months as to the nostalgic gamers, but it's not really there anymore 3 months post market entry. Guess the nostalgy crowd purchased their thing and put it in the shelve of memories."

I don't think they can possibly match it. I think they're best off not trying, and instead staying the course. Making PlayStation THE spot to play high quality narrative single player experiences (which they currently are). That's an area Xbox is not close to them in. PS can be like the movie theater or HBO, while Xbox is like Netflix.

2419,2022-11-25 13:47:00,">No, I don't think ATVI is a good short now that the buyout deal is uncertain. The reason being that if the FTC does sue to block Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard, it's likely because they believe that the deal would be anticompetitive and hurt consumers. However, I believe that Microsoft would ultimately prevail in court and be allowed to go through with the acquisition. Therefore, I think there's more upside potential for ATVI than downside risk at this point."

If this deal fall through they will receive 3B from Microsoft. 

They will have over 10B cash, no debt. 

At 57B market cap they are sitting on 18x 2023 earnings (15x if you subtract cash). 

They also have WB/Munger as investors pre microsoft deal, who think very highly of Kotick as they sit on Cokes board together.
